Undo reverts operation made upon object.  
It stores the object state before the mutator operation and allows to
restore this state later.

Undo uses adapters for storage (Redis, ActiveRecord, etc) and custom
serializers (ActiveRecord, Virtus, etc). It is very lightweight
solution that can be used as well with heavy ActiveRecord as with
simple Hash or Virtus objects. No database required: store data as it
suites you.

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'undo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install undo

Requirements
------------
1. Ruby 1.9 or above
1. gem virtus ~> 1.0

Usage
-----

### Undo operation

``` ruby
uuid = Undo.store object
Undo.restore uuid
```
That is basically it :)

Additionally possible to wrap object in Undo decorator:

``` ruby
decorated_object = Undo.wrap object
Undo.restore decorated_object.uuid
```
Use decorated_object as usual afterwards. Undo gem will store object
state on each hit to `mutator methods`. By default mutator_methods are
`update`, `delete`, `destroy`. Those methods can be changed either in
place or using global configuration (see below).

To use something more advanced rather plain memory storage and
pass through serializer, configure the Undo:  

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.storage = Undo::Storage::RailsCache.new
  config.serializer = Undo::Serializer::ActiveModel.new
end
```
gem `undo-storage-rails_cache` and gem `undo-serializer-active_model` are required for this.  
There are a bunch of other Rails free adapters. Read about them in configuration chapter below.

When required to manually delete stored data in storage:

``` ruby
Undo.delete uuid
```
Accepts same options as store/restore

### UUID

By default uuids are generated by `SecureRandom.uuid`. The generator is managed by `uuid_generator` 
setting (see below in configuration chapter).

UUID can be provided to both #wrap and #store methods and it will be used instead of generated one:  

``` ruby
uuid = "uniq identifier"

Undo.store object, uuid: uuid
Undo.restore uuid
```

If object respond to #uuid method then it value will be used instead:

``` ruby
object = OpenStruct.new uuid: "uniq identifier"
Undo.store object # => uniq identifier
Undo.restore "uniq identifier"
```

### Configuration options

`storage` option responsible for storing and fetching object state to or from some storage.

Implement `store(uuid, object)`, `fetch(uuid)` and optionally `delete(uuid)` 
methods (ruby `Hash` interface).

Currently available storages:
* `Undo::Storage::Memory` simple runtime storage (Hash)
* `gem "undo-storage-rails_cache"` designed for Rails, but can be used with any ducktype cache store
* `gem "undo-storage-redis"` designed to be used with `gem "redis"` from v0.1 to current

See also [documentation](http://github.com/AlexParamonov/undo)
on project repository for full list of currently available storage adapters.

To convert objects to data that can be processed by storage adapters and backward, use `serializers`:

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.serializer = CustomSerializer.new
end
```

Currently available serializers:
* `Undo::Serializer::Null` pass though serializer. It do nothing and returns whatever passed to it.
* `gem undo-serializer-active_model` depends on #attributes method so can be used with Virtus and PORO objects as well as with ActiveRecord objects.

Check [documentation](http://github.com/AlexParamonov/undo) on project
repository for currently available serializers.

`uuid_generator` option allows to setup custom uuid generator.

By default it is using `SecureRandom.uuid`.  
To define custom uuid generator use `uuid_generator` option:

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.uuid_generator = ->(object) { "#{object.class.name}_#{object.id}" }
end
```

`mutator methods` option defines a list of methods that will trigger storing the object state
By default mutator_methods are `update`, `delete`, `destroy`.  
To append custom mutator_methods use  

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.mutator_methods += [:put, :push, :pop]
end
```

### In place configuration

Any configuration option from previous chapter can be applied in
place for given operation. To restore object from another storage use
`storage` option:

``` ruby
Undo.restore uuid, storage: AnotherStorage.new
```

To wrap an object using custom mutator_methods use `mutator_methods` option:

``` ruby
Undo.wrap object, mutator_methods: [:save]
```

To use custom serializer or deserializer use `serializer` option:

``` ruby
Undo.wrap post, serializer: PostSerializer.new(post)
post.destroy
Undo.restore uuid, serializer: PostDeserializer.new(options)
```

Additionally when given serializer accepts additional options to
`#serialize` or `#deserialize`, those options can be set in place as well:

``` ruby
Undo.store post, include: :comments
```
