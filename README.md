Undo last operation on object.  
Undo gem allows to use custom adapters for storage (Redis,
ActiveRecord, etc). And custom serializers when need (ActiveRecord, Virtus, etc)

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'undo'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install undo

Requirements
------------
1. Ruby 1.9 or above
1. gem virtus ~> 1.0

Usage
-----

### Undo operation

Wrap object in Undo decorator:

``` ruby
Undo.wrap object
```

And use it as usual afterwards. Undo gem will store object state on each hit to `mutator methods`.  
By default mutator_methods are `update`, `delete`, `destroy`.  
To append custom mutator_methods use  

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.mutator_methods += [:put, :push, :pop]
end
```

To restore previous version

```
Undo.restore uuid
```

`uuid` is provided by wrapped object:

```
Undo.wrap(object).uuid
```

By default it is using `SecureRandom.uuid`.  
To define custom uuid generator use `uuid_generator` option:

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.uuid_generator = ->(object) { "#{object.class.name}_#{object.id}" }
end
```

### Configuration options
`storage` option responsible for putting and fetching object state to or from some storage.  
Implement `put(uuid, object)` and `fetch(uuid)` methods. See MemoryAdapter for example.  
See also [documentation](http://github.com/AlexParamonov/undo)
on project repository for currently available storage adapters.  
If provided storage cant handle objects (most of the storage works with own formats as json for example),
pass `serializer` to it:

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.storage = AnotherStorage.new(serializer: config.serializer)
end
```

By default here is very basic `Serializer::Simple`.  
There are no more serializers available now, but check
[documentation](http://github.com/AlexParamonov/undo) on project
repository for currently available serializers.

Serializer is not used by `Undo` gem directly. It mean to be used in
storage adopters to serialize and deserialize data to required format.  
Storage adapter may use serializer this way:

``` ruby
json = serializer.to_json object # in put method
return serializer.from_json json # in fetch method

xml = serializer.to_xml object
object = serializer.from_xml xml
```

Usage of serializer is optional, some storages does not need them.  
Serializer has the responsibility to write object to persistence
(from\_\* methods) This seems a good candinate to extraction to own
class (Deserializer or Loader) but due to to\_\* and from\_\*
method are tightly coupled with data format it is in one class now.
Let me know using the Github feedback (create an issue) if you have
any idea on this topic.

`uuid_generator` option allows to setup custom uuid generator.

By default it is using `SecureRandom.uuid`.  
To define custom uuid generator use `uuid_generator` option:

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.uuid_generator = ->(object) { "#{object.class.name}_#{object.id}" }
end
```

`mutator methods` option defines a list of methods that will trigger storage#put
By default mutator_methods are `update`, `delete`, `destroy`.  
To set custom mutator_methods use  

``` ruby
Undo.configure do |config|
  config.mutator_methods = [:put, :push, :pop]
end
```

### In place configuration
Any configuration option from previous chapter can be applied in place
only for given operation.  
To restore object from another storage use `storage` option:

``` ruby
Undo.restore uuid, storage: AnotherStorage.new
```

To wrap an object using custom serializer use `serializer` option:

``` ruby
Undo.wrap object, serializer: AnotherSerializer.new
```
